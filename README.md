# SortAlgorithms

This code requires javax.swing, java.awt, java.awt.event, java.util.

Run VisualizeAlgorithms.java to open the GUI. The GUI displays sorting algorithms by sorting shuffled bars into ascending order by height. The "Run Method" section of the side panel offers the user to run a single alogrithm, or compare two or four algorithms simultaneously. The "Execution" section of the side panel allows the user to shuffle, then sort the bars. The lower section of the side panel contains the buttons "Skip" and "Reset". "Skip" disables all time delays and allows the sorting algorithms to complete.  "Reset" allows the user to reselect run parameters. 

During sorting, a running counter of array swaps is displayed next to the name of each sorting algorithm. Red and blue bars indicate the current index of the array being swapped. Algorithms that can be tested include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Radix Sort.
